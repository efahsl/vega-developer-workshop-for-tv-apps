I want you to act as a technical writer. We are hosting a developer workshop at a React Native conference. We have put our content originally in a tool called "Quip" and have exported to a Word document: "vega-devtools-mcp RN London Conf: Vega hands-on workshop.docx".

Your task is to convert this to GitHub-flavored markdown files, preserving all images that were included in the Word Document. Put those images into an images/ folder. Read (or convert the word document) first. The markdown files should be in the format similar to the following, where each section from the Word document should go into the corresponding markdown file:

0_prequisites.md
1_create_hello_world_app.md
2_set_up_mcp_server.md
3_create_3_screen_app.md
4_performance_testing.md
5_performance_improvements.md
6_next_steps

Each document should contain a link to the "next" and the "previous" step at the bottom of each page, linking to the corresponding markdown files.

Take your time on this if you need it, I value accuracy over spee. I'm not in a hurry.
